# WHAT: A Continuous Integration (CI) script for kicking the build
#       whenever a ruby file within the project is saved.
#
#       It's Async-safe!

# USAGE: If you have Vim, check out the Dubsacks Vim plugin:
#
#          https://github.com/landonb/dubs_edit_juice
#
#        which automatically looks for a .trustme.vim above
#        any file you load into a buffer.
#
#        You can install the plugin or just copy the BufEnter
#        autocmd that loads for the .trustme.vim file, from:
#
#          plugin/dubs_edit_juice.vim
#
#        Or, if you're not using Vim, wire this shell script
#        to be called on file save however you are able to
#        do that.
#
#          Maybe check out inotifywait:
#
#            https://linux.die.net/man/1/inotifywait
#
# NOTE: On Vim, if you're using the project.vim plugin, you'll need
#       to add a reference to the script from the directory entry.
#       Otherwise, when you double-click files in the project window
#       to open them, the BufEnter event doesn't trigger properly.
#       E.g.,
#
#         MURANO_CLI=/exo/clients/exosite/MuranoCLI filter=".* *" in=".trustme.vim" {
#           .agignore
#           # ...
#         }
#
# MONITOR: All script output gets writ to a file. Use a terminal to tail it:
#
#            tail -F .trustme.log

# MEH: Need to enable errexit?
#set +x

OUT_FILE=".trustme.log"

#local DONE_FILE=".trustme.done"
LOCK_DIR=".trustme.lock"
KILL_DIR=".trustme.kill"
PID_FILE=".trustme.pid"
# Hrm. The bang might not work without
KILL_BIN=".trustme.kill!"

# 2017-10-03: Don't build immediately after every save. If you like to
# code a little, save, code a little save, repeat, then always running
# the builder (a) gets annoying to see constantly churning, if you keep
# a terminal on it; and (b) runs the CPU hot, because eslint. So avoid
# building too frequently.
# LATER/2017-10-03: CLI options for this script? It keeps growing!
# For now, hardcode.

# NOTE: Environs from Jenkins, like ${WORKSPACE} or any passwords you
#   inject, are not available from here (Build Environment setup).

# This is already a given, but just to be clear:
USER root

# Jenkins defaults to the ASCII encoding, but we want UTF-8.
#
# FIXME/MEH: (lb): Murano CLI still has encoding issues, e.g.,
# the highline.say() command crashes on some strings, complaining:
#
#   invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII
#
# which we currently work around by running Murand CLI in ASCII, e.g.,
#
#   murano --no-progress --no-color --ascii ...
#
# which means our Jenkins/Docker test is not quite testing how
# people usually run the app. Oh well.
#
# ((lb): I had hoped that setting ENV herein would help, and while it
# does change the encoding for the `docker exec` command that Jenkins
# runs later, it doesn't fix the "invalid byte sequence" error.)
#
# NOTE: You cannot change the encoding from the Execute Shell build
# command. If you tried, you'd see, e.g.,:
#
#   $ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
#   setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
#
# ALSO: Skip LC_ALL, otherwise when Jenkins runs `docker exec ...` you'll see:
#
#   /bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)

ENV LANGUAGE en_US.UTF-8
ENV LANG en_US.UTF-8

# Jenkins runs the Execute Shell script on Docker as the 'jenkins' user,
# but Docker is confused unless we create that user now and assign it the
# UID that gets used. ((lb): This is hacky; Ops might fix this eventually.)
#
# Without adding the user to the root group and having them run as such,
# we'd see Errno::EACCES "Permission denied @ rb_sysopen" errors, and we'd
# have to do the hideous, grotesque act of granting permissions to all:
#
#    RUN /bin/chmod -R go+w /app
#    RUN /bin/chmod 2777 /app

RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash --uid 1001 -G root jenkins

# Create the /app directory and give ownership to the new user, otherwise
# if we switch to the new user first, they cannot create the workdir.

RUN mkdir /app && /bin/chown -R jenkins /app
#RUN /bin/chmod 2777 /app
RUN /bin/ls -la /app

# Run as the new jenkins user, otherwise Ruby gem permissions are
# restrictive, and we don't want to have to fudge them, e.g.,
#
#   # Madness!
#   RUN chmod 2777 /usr/local/bundle
#   RUN chmod 2777 /usr/local/bundle/bin
#   RUN find /usr/local/bundle -type d -exec chmod 2777 {} +
#   RUN find /usr/local/bundle -type f -exec chmod u+rw,g+rw,o+rw {} +
